# FPIdentifier
This project focuses on identifying transposable elements (TEs) that are misidentified as genes in genomic annotations. The tool uses **HMMER** to compare protein sequences against the **REXdb** database and detects potential transposon-related domains.

## Project Goals
- Identify transposons misannotated as genes in plant genomes.
- Utilize HMMER for domain detection from protein sequences.
- Integrate with the **REXdb** transposon database for precise identification.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Flymetothemoon93/FPIdentifier.git
